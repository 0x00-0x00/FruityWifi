A more flexible control panel. Now it is possible to use FruityWifi combining multiple networks and setups: 

Within the new options on the control panel we can change the AP mode between Hostapd or Airmon-ng allowing to use more chipsets like Realtek. 

It is possible customize each one of the network interfaces which allows the user to keep the current setup or change it completely.

FruityWifi is based on modules making it more flexible. These modules can be installed from the control panel to provide FruityWifi with new functionalities. 

Within the available modules you can find URLsnarf, DNSspoof, Kismet, mdk3, ngrep, nmap, Squid3 y SSLstrip (code injection functionality), Captive Portal, AutoSSH, Meterpreter, Tcpdump and more.
